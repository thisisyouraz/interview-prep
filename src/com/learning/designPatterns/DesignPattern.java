	/*
	SOLID : is an acronym that represents the five most important design principals in creating a flexible, more understandable
	and maintainable code.

		1 - Single Responsibility principle.
		2 - Open close principle.
		3 - Liskov substitution principle.
		4 - Interface segregation principle.
		5 - Dependency inversion principle.

		Single responsibility principle:
			There should be only one reason to change a class. This suggests that one class should only be focused
			on one functionality.

		Open close principal:
			software entities (Class, methods, modules) should be open for extension but close for modification.
			which means in order to add new functionality to a software one should be able to achieve that without
			modifying the already written and tested code. (This principal based on inheritance)
			- Base classes are generally closed for modification and child classes can be modified or one can
			  create a new child class by extending the base class.
