Git:-
    Git is a version control system which is used to track changes in a code and coordinating with other developers
    working on a project. It keeps the history of changes made to a code. Using git we can create new branch and
    work on new functionality independently and once that feature is ready we can merge the branch into the main
    branch.

GitHub:-
    GitHub is a web-based platform which hosts the git repositories and provide additional features like, issue
    tracking , pull request, project management tools, and more. Developers use gitHub to store there repositories
    in the cloud, which helps in sharing code and collaboration.

    In summary git is VCS which is used to track changes and gitHub is a web portal which hosts the repositories.
